Schema Explanation:

artifact relation has artifact_id column of data type varchar to accomodate characters in artifact_id
and is primary key because it is good candidate to establish uniqueness in artifact relation. Width, height, 
dimension and humidity are numeric because they are measurable values. material column is foreign key to material 
relation. I created a material relation so it's useful for querying the material expertise relation
used to identify all the experts of a certain material.
Created employee relation so it's SIN primary key can be used by separate guide and technician relations by using 
in as foreign key in guide and technician relations. technician_job_type relation would be useful later on for 
allowing a discrete number of choices(conservationist, restorer or both) for technician's job type in technician 
relation. material expertise relation uses technician.sin as foreign key so guides cannot be included in this 
relation primary key is both columns to establish uniqueness. test relation has test_num as primary key because 
it is unique. inspection relation uses artifact.artifact_id, technician.technician_sin, test.test_num as foreign 
keys so that it only refers to pre-existing values for those 3 columns, which when grouped together form a unique 
primary key. Date used as type for dates because more suitable than integer.
